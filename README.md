# VR-Point-Cloud-Analysis-V.1
3D Point Cloud VR viewer to explore and analyze enriched point clouds with scalar fields.

The goal of this Unity project is to interactively explore point clouds, allowing the user to access all the temporal thermal information associated with the points, in an intuitive and visual way, using a color scale representation.
